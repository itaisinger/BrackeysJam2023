sfx:
eye open


as of now, when nmes use items, they are not consumed. is this cool?


things done bad:
effectiveness text output
making attacks that cant miss
moves are set when they are sent to the manager and dont account for changed the accour in the turn before their, 
	like using an item and it can be stolen then immedietly used.
